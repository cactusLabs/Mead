# Mead
Repository for notes relating to mead making experiments

##Notes

##Experiment #1:  Windmill Hill, Bristol, UK.  Began 6 October 2020

* 2 batches were made - a standard mead, and a second that followed standard mead recipe, but with additional raspberries and juice (see note below)
* As in usual fermentation, it is important to keep everything clean. There are products for this that are cheap and readily available.  Clean surfaces, utensils, vessels and your hands
* 5 Gallon (~4.5L) glass carboys were used with water filled airlocks.

###Standard Mead Recipe

* Raw honey used was 'Payne's Blossom Honey' - I bought 3.17kg and split evenly between the two batches.  This was likely too much.  I *did not* use heat to dissolve the honey - you can dissolve by either stirring into the water using a spoon & bucket, or by funneling the honey and water into the carboy, plugging it and shaking for 5 minutes.
* Once the honey and water has been disolved in a carboy, syphon some out into a beaker and the initial hydrometer reading was taken (the initial density of the honey and water)
* Yeast used was Lalvin D47 (~14% alcohol tolerance).  Pitched in 50ml water @ ~35 degrees for 20 minutes before gently stirring, then added to the carboy honey/water to create the 'must'.
* Yeast nutrient used was Diammonium Phosphate - after the hydrometer reading, a teaspoon of nutrient was added to the beaker and left to sit for 20 minutes
* 20 minutes after the pitched yeast was added to the carboy honey/water mixture, the yeast nutrient was added.  Yeast nutrient is used in Mead fermentation because honey, although high in natural sugur, especially lacks a source of nitrogen
* Once the honey, water, yeast and yeast nutrient was added to the carboy, it was sealed and left in a dark, cool place for 4-6 weeks.  In this case, we stored it in an unheated kitchen, temperature range was ~8-20 degrees, left on a window sill, with the blinds closed, wrapped in a thick beach towel.  Ideally, it should be stored at ~15 degrees in a dark room/cupboard, away from both natural and artificial light.  

###'ZoZo Berry' Mead

* The above 'Standard Mead Recipe' was followed, but with 1 cup (~236mL) of orange juice (with pulp) and a small punnet of raspberries (washed, but not sterilised and quartered) were added
* In hindsight and upon further research, the orange juice was a huge mistake. *Do NOT* use citrus juice in mead production - you will find loads of comments in forums related to orange juice introducing a 'vomit' taste to your brew. A much better option would have been apple juice.   I think the saving grace for this batch will be the relatively small amount of OJ added. Having said that, the extra sugar from the fruits made the yeast go crazy, and it is currently a *very* strong batch of kinda weird tasting, almost 'tart' mead.
* This carboy was racked after 1 month to remove the fruit remnants (leaving fruit for too long during fermentation is going to introduce some bad flavours). We poured the fruit and left over must into a muslin cloth and gently squeezed out some yeast before returning it to the second carboy (unsure whether this was wise?!)
* This second carboy was racked a second time 2 weeks later (6 weeks after it was first put down) 
I am considering re-racking for a third time, and adding some dark cocoa for 6 months or so to try to salvage it... it's not *too* bad at the moment, but   Another option would be to freeze the batch and removing some ice before bottling... basically moving towards a 'honey, chocolate orange liquor'... could be crazy enough to work?!
