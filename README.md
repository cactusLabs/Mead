# Mead
Repository for notes relating to mead making experiments

##Experiment #1:  Began 6 October 2020

* 2 batches made - a standard mead, and a standard mead with raspberries and juice
* 5 Gallon (~4.5L) glass carboys used with water filled airlocks.
* Yeast used was Lalvin D47 (~14% alcohol tolerance).  Pitched in 50ml water @ ~35 degrees for 20 minutes before gently stirring, then added to the must.
* Raw honey used was 'Payne's Blossom Honey' - I bought 3.17kg and split evenly between the two batches.  This was likely too much.
