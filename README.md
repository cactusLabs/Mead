# Mead
Repository for notes relating to mead making experiments

##Experiment #1:  Began 6 October 2020

* 2 batches were made - a standard mead, and a second that followed standard mead recipe, but with additional raspberries and juice (see note below)
* As in usual fermentation, it is important to keep everything clean. There are products for this that are cheap and readily available.  Clean surfaces, utensils, vessels and your hands
* 5 Gallon (~4.5L) glass carboys were used with water filled airlocks.

###Standard Mead Recipe

* Raw honey used was 'Payne's Blossom Honey' - I bought 3.17kg and split evenly between the two batches.  This was likely too much.  I *did not* use heat to dissolve the honey - you can dissolve by either stirring into the water using a spoon & bucket, or by funneling the honey and water into the carboy, plugging it and shaking for 5 minutes.
* Once the honey and water has been disolved in a carboy, syphon some out into a beaker and the initial hydrometer reading was taken (the initial density of the honey and water)
* Yeast used was Lalvin D47 (~14% alcohol tolerance).  Pitched in 50ml water @ ~35 degrees for 20 minutes before gently stirring, then added to the carboy honey/water to create the 'must'.
* Yeast nutrient used was Diammonium Phosphate - after the hydrometer reading, a teaspoon of nutrient was added to the beaker and left to sit for 20 minutes
* 20 minutes after the pitched yeast was added to the carboy honey/water mixture, the yeast nutrient was added.  Yeast nutrient is used in Mead fermentation because honey, although high in natural sugur, especially lacks a source of nitrogen
