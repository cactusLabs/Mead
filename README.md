Repository for notes relating to mead making experiments

##Experiment #1:  Began 6 October 2020

* 2 batches made - a standard mead, and anohter that followed standard mead recipe, but with additional raspberries and juice

###Standard Mead Recipe

* 5 Gallon (~4.5L) glass carboys used with water filled airlocks.
* Raw honey used was 'Payne's Blossom Honey' - I bought 3.17kg and split evenly between the two batches.  This was likely too much.  I *did not* use heat to dissolve the honey - you can dissolve by either stirring into the water using a spoon & bucket, or by funneling the honey and water into the carboy, plugging it and shaking for 5 minutes.
* Once the honey and water has been disolved in a carboy, syphon some out into a 
* Yeast nutrient used was Diammonium Phosphate - after initial hydrometer reading was taken (the initial density of the honey and water), a teaspoon of nutrient was added to this and returned to the carboy 20 minutes after the yeast had been added.
* Yeast used was Lalvin D47 (~14% alcohol tolerance).  Pitched in 50ml water @ ~35 degrees for 20 minutes before gently stirring, then added to the carboy honey/water to create the 'must'.
