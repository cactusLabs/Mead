# Mead
Repository for notes relating to mead making experiment during Lock Down.

## Notes

* 'Racking' is the process of moving the mead from one receptacle to another
* 'Primary' refers to the initial period of fermentation
* 'Secondary' refers to the following period of fermentation
* 'Racking to secondary' is a misnomer, as the fermentation should enter secondary regardless of being racked or not... it is a chemical process independent of the vessel in which it is stored

## Experiment #1:  Windmill Hill, Bristol, UK.  Began 6 October 2020
* 2 batches were made - a standard mead, and a second that followed standard mead recipe, but with additional raspberries and juice (see note below)
* As in usual fermentation, it is important to keep everything clean. There are products for this that are cheap and readily available.  Clean surfaces, utensils, vessels and your hands
* 5 Gallon (~4.5L) glass carboys were used with water filled airlocks (although some people use cheap vodka in the airlocks)

### Standard Mead Recipe
* Raw honey used was 'Payne's Blossom Honey' - I bought 3.17kg and split evenly between the two batches.  This was likely too much.  I *did not* use heat to dissolve the honey - I've read that this removes some of the goodness/flavours and should be avoided.  However, there are risks associated with using raw honey, so it's up to the brewer.  Blossom honey isn't that fancy, there are better options... but given that this was the first experiment, I didn't want to go all out 
* You can dissolve the honey into the water by either a) stirring into water using a spoon & bucket for 5+ minutes before funnelling into a carboy; *or* b) by funneling the honey and water into the carboy, plugging it and shaking for 5 minutes.  
* Once the honey and water has been dissolved in a carboy, syphon some out into a beaker and the initial hydrometer reading is taken (the initial density of the honey and water)
* Yeast used was Lalvin D47 (~14% alcohol tolerance).  Pitched in 50ml water @ ~35 degrees for 20 minutes before gently stirring, then added to the carboy honey/water to create the 'must'.
* Yeast nutrient used was Diammonium Phosphate - after the hydrometer reading, a teaspoon of nutrient was added to the beaker and left to sit for 20 minutes
* 20 minutes after the pitched yeast was added to the carboy honey/water mixture, the yeast nutrient was added.  Yeast nutrient is used in Mead fermentation because honey, although high in natural sugur, especially lacks a source of nitrogen
* Once the honey, water, yeast and yeast nutrient was added to the carboy, it was sealed and left in a dark, cool place for 4-6 weeks.  In this case, we stored it in an unheated kitchen, temperature range was ~8-20 degrees, left on a window sill, with the blinds closed, wrapped in a thick beach towel.  Ideally, it should be stored at ~15 degrees in a dark room/cupboard, away from both natural and artificial light.  

### 'ZoZo Berry' Mead
* The above 'Standard Mead Recipe' was followed, but with 1 cup (~236mL) of orange juice (with pulp) and a small punnet of raspberries (washed, but not sterilised and quartered) were added
* In hindsight and upon further research, the orange juice was a huge mistake. *Do NOT* use citrus juice in mead production - you will find loads of comments in forums related to orange juice introducing a 'vomit' taste to your brew. A much better option would have been apple juice.   I think the saving grace for this batch will be the relatively small amount of OJ added. Having said that, the extra sugar from the fruits made the yeast go crazy, and it is currently a *very* strong batch of kinda weird tasting, almost 'tart' mead.

### Racking...
* You rack to a new carboy to remove dead yeast, etc to improve flavour, clarity, etc of the mead.  
* Racking usually occurs 4-6 weeks into fermentation.
* Care is taken to not move the carboy so as not to disturb the dead yeast, etc that forms at the bottom of the carboy.  

#### Progress...
* The 'Standard Mead' was racked after ~6 weeks using a manual syphon, filtered through some muslin cloth.  
* The 'ZoZo Berry' carboy was racked after 1 month (8 Nov 2020) to remove the fruit remnants (leaving fruit for too long during fermentation is going to introduce some bad flavours). We poured the fruit and the left over must into a muslin cloth and gently squeezed out some yeast before returning it to the second carboy (unsure whether this was wise?!)
* This 'ZoZo Berry' carboy was racked a second time 21 Nov 2020 (~6 weeks after it was first put down - and at the same time as the 'Standard Mead' was racked) 
* This 'ZoZo Berry' carboy was racked a third time 15 Dec 2020

### Density Readings

#### 6 October 2020 
* Standard Mead 1.13
* ZoZo Berry  1.12

#### Racked 8 November 2020
* ZoZo Berry 1.020 - added 1/4 teaspoon of yeast nutrient dissolved in the must used to measure density

#### Racked 21 November 2020
* Standard Mead 1.061 - added a small 1/4 teaspoon of yeast nutrient dissolved in the must used to measure density
* ZoZo Berry  1.012 - taken before topping solution up with a little water (boiled and allowed to cool first)

### Alcohol content
* When you first mix the must, the specific gravity reading should be between 1.06 and 1.12 which is pretty normal but may vary depending on how much honey is used.
* I believe that alcohol content of the must may be estimated using the equation - (Initial Gravity - Final Gravity) x 131.25

#### Therefore, current estimates:
* Standard Mead = ~9%
* ZoZo Berry  = ~14%

### Stabilising

Stabilised both meads 10 January 2020.  Used Potassium Metabisulifite (K-Met): (1/4 teaspoon in ZoZo Berry and the Standard Mead) and Potassium Sulphate (1/4 teaspon in ZoZo Berry and 3/4 teaspoon in Standard Mead).  Mixed PM & PS into some water, before adding solution to each 5 gallon carboy.


### Bottled

Bottled both batches 17 January, 2021.  To age for at least 6 months before testing.
