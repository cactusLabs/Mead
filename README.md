# Mead
Repository for notes relating to mead making experiments

## Notes

* 'Racking' is the process of moving the mead from one receptacle to another
* 'Primary' refers to the initial period of fermentation
* 'Secondary' refers to the following period of fermentation
* 'Racking to secondary' is a misnomer, as the fermentation should enter secondary regardless of being racked or not... it is a chemical process independent of the vessel it is stored in

## Experiment #1:  Windmill Hill, Bristol, UK.  Began 6 October 2020

* 2 batches were made - a standard mead, and a second that followed standard mead recipe, but with additional raspberries and juice (see note below)
* As in usual fermentation, it is important to keep everything clean. There are products for this that are cheap and readily available.  Clean surfaces, utensils, vessels and your hands
* 5 Gallon (~4.5L) glass carboys were used with water filled airlocks.

### Standard Mead Recipe

* Raw honey used was 'Payne's Blossom Honey' - I bought 3.17kg and split evenly between the two batches.  This was likely too much.  I *did not* use heat to dissolve the honey - you can dissolve by either stirring into the water using a spoon & bucket, or by funneling the honey and water into the carboy, plugging it and shaking for 5 minutes.
* Once the honey and water has been dissolved in a carboy, syphon some out into a beaker and the initial hydrometer reading was taken (the initial density of the honey and water)
* Yeast used was Lalvin D47 (~14% alcohol tolerance).  Pitched in 50ml water @ ~35 degrees for 20 minutes before gently stirring, then added to the carboy honey/water to create the 'must'.
* Yeast nutrient used was Diammonium Phosphate - after the hydrometer reading, a teaspoon of nutrient was added to the beaker and left to sit for 20 minutes
* 20 minutes after the pitched yeast was added to the carboy honey/water mixture, the yeast nutrient was added.  Yeast nutrient is used in Mead fermentation because honey, although high in natural sugur, especially lacks a source of nitrogen
* Once the honey, water, yeast and yeast nutrient was added to the carboy, it was sealed and left in a dark, cool place for 4-6 weeks.  In this case, we stored it in an unheated kitchen, temperature range was ~8-20 degrees, left on a window sill, with the blinds closed, wrapped in a thick beach towel.  Ideally, it should be stored at ~15 degrees in a dark room/cupboard, away from both natural and artificial light.  

### 'ZoZo Berry' Mead

* The above 'Standard Mead Recipe' was followed, but with 1 cup (~236mL) of orange juice (with pulp) and a small punnet of raspberries (washed, but not sterilised and quartered) were added
* In hindsight and upon further research, the orange juice was a huge mistake. *Do NOT* use citrus juice in mead production - you will find loads of comments in forums related to orange juice introducing a 'vomit' taste to your brew. A much better option would have been apple juice.   I think the saving grace for this batch will be the relatively small amount of OJ added. Having said that, the extra sugar from the fruits made the yeast go crazy, and it is currently a *very* strong batch of kinda weird tasting, almost 'tart' mead.

### Racking

* You rack to a new carboy to remove dead yeast, etc to improve flavour, clarity, etc of the mead.  
* Racking usually occurs 4-6 weeks into fermentation.
* Care is taken to not move the carboy so as not to disturb the dead yeast, etc that forms at the bottom of the carboy.  

* The 'Standard Mead' was racked after ~6 weeks using a manual syphon, filtered through some muslin cloth.  
* The 'ZoZo Berry' carboy was racked after 1 month to remove the fruit remnants (leaving fruit for too long during fermentation is going to introduce some bad flavours). We poured the fruit and the left over must into a muslin cloth and gently squeezed out some yeast before returning it to the second carboy (unsure whether this was wise?!)
* This second carboy was racked a second time ~2 weeks later (~6 weeks after it was first put down - and at the same time as the 'Standard Mead' was racked) 
* I am considering racking the 'ZoZo Berry' for a third time, adding some dark cocoa for 6 months or so to try to salvage it... it's not *too* bad at the moment, but could be better.  I am also considering freezing the batch to remove some ice before bottling... basically moving it towards a 'honey, chocolate orange liquor'... could be crazy enough to work?!

### Density Readings

#### 6 October 2020 
Standard Mead 1.13
ZoZo Berry  1.12

#### Racked 8 November 2020
ZoZo Berry 1.020 - added 1/4 teaspoon of yeast nutrient dissolved in the must used to measure density

#### Racked 21 November 2020
Standard Mead 1.061 - added a small 1/4 teaspoon of yeast nutrient dissolved in the must used to measure density
ZoZo Berry  1.012 - taken before topping solution up with a little water (boiled and allowed to cool first)

### Alcohol content

* When you first mix the must, the specific gravity reading should be between 1.06 and 1.12 which is pretty normal but may vary depending on how much honey is used.
* I believe that alcohol content of the must may be estimated using the following equation:

(Initial Gravity - Final Gravity) x 131.25

Therefore, current estimates:

Standard Mead = ~9%
ZoZo Berry  = ~14%

### Future Plans

* We may have to rack the 'ZoZo Berry' a third and final time to remove remnant dead yeast from the bottom.  It makes sense that this carboy has more dead yeast present - as the extra fruit means extra sugar for the yeast to feast on, sending them crazy until the alcohol content got so high that it was too much for the yeast, killing it.  If you compare the Lalvin D47 tolerance (14%) with the above alchohol content estimate (14%), this would support the theory.  I'll probably do this one month after the last racking.
* I plan on leaving both batches in carboys for 6 months before bottling for at least 9 months
* The yeast needs to be killed before bottling - to prevent unwanted fermentation and lower the risk of explosions.  The combination of potassium sorbate and potassium sulfite (campden tablets) will prevent renewed fermentation.  This is usually completed before any back-sweetening.  Given the amount of honey used in this experiment, I currently don't plan on back-sweeting.  Follow instruction provided on products, but I've found people on forums advising '1 campden tablet and 1/2 tsp sorbate per gallon on finished cider, wine or mead dissolved in a small amount of water or product. Once treated you can back sweeten. I usually leave wait to sweeten until 1 or 2 days after treating. And you should wait a week or two after treating before bottling to prevent any sulphur smells.'
